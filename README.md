## Why ITER-MATERIAL-APP ?

We examined that, during the pandemic, all things are going online, so students will need educational stuff such as notes, assignments, and previous year's questions. For this, they will waste their time here and there searching for resources and guidance, so we came up with this idea of placing all the stuff and guidance in one place so that there is no issue with accessing them.

## About The Project
